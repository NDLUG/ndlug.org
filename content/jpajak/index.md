My name is Gavin Inglis. I am a current junior studying computer science at the University of Notre Dame. My main interests are Systems Programming and Linux, but I enjoy reading and learning about all things computer science. 
I am a SysAdmin and Secretary for the [Notre Dame Linux Users Group](http://ndlug.org). I most recently worked for [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en) on a project in the Public Health space in Cincinnati. I was introduced to Salesforce tools, and I had experience developing and administrating in Salesforce. 
This coming spring I will be participiating in the Notre Dame Silicon Valley Semester, a program offered by ND out in the valley for students looking to take relevant courses and work at local companies/startups. 
Apart from my computer science related coursework, extracurriculars, and interests, I like to play video games (Rocket League mainly), run, work at the [Debartolo Performing Arts Center](https://performingarts.nd.edu/) in the ticket office, hang out on IRC (garvin on snoonet and freenode), and read. I also love coffee - currently using an [AeroPress](https://aeropress.com/) as it is very convenient to use in college.
