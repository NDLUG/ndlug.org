Hiya, I'm Mike Eisemann, but most of you probably know me as AndroidKitKat. I'm the current Vice President of NDLUG. I am a computer science major and thinking about minoring in Japanese. Some of my favorite things are VR video games and learning Japanese. If you want to read more about me, check out my personal website at https://www.michaeleisemann.com/
