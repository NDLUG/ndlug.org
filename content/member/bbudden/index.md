<br>
My name is Brad Budden. I am a current sophomore studying computer science at the University of Notre Dame. I'm not sure
exactly what field of computer science I will be most interested in, but I enjoy learning about linux and have fun with embedded systems programming for arduinos. 
<br>
<br>
Last summer, I studied abroad in Rome, taking classes in quantum engineering and visual programming. I and was able to travel all over Italy and to Greece, Switzerland, and Sweden
<br>
<br>
Next spring I hope to participate in the Notre Dame Silicon Valley Semester, a
program offered by ND out in the valley for students looking to take relevant courses and work at local companies/startups.
<br>
<br>
Apart from my computer science related coursework and ND LUG, I like to play basketball and workout. I also occasionally enjoy playing a few video games.
