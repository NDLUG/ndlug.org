My name's Kathryn Hund, and I'm currently a freshman at Saint Mary's.

I'm from Florida (on the east coast - right in the destruction path of every hurricane). My intended major is Computing & Applied Mathematics.

I'm looking forward to participating in NDLUG to get more familiar with both Linux in particular and open source in general.

My current goals are to become an active contributor to open source, and to participate in Google Summer of Code at least once.

*side note: My current mission is to collect as many free purple coding t-shirts as possible. If you know anywhere else I can get one, please let me know.*
