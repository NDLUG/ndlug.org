*Hi! My name is Nolan McShea and I'm a sophomore majoring in Computer Science! I recently just dropped my digital marketing minor so I can't say that I'm minoring in digital marketing anymore, which stinks but it was boring so I don't care. My college-long objective is to make a video game! (I wanna finish it by the time I graduate) So right now I'm trying to learn digital music.*
