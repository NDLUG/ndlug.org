Hey, I'm Zephan Enciso, a junior studying Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering.  I typically run Arch Linux with KDE and/or i3-gaps.  Most LUGites know me as a huge computer hardware nerd, but outside of LUG, I enjoy olympic archery, playing violin, taking pictures, or pwning noobs in video games.
