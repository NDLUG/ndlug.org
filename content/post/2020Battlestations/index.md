## Intro/Catchup

Our hosts began the meeting/podcast with a brief update of what they've been up to since last week.
It turns out AKK has been busy reading and watching some vehemently anti-[systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) propaganda.
In all seriousness, he did raise some solid points and was more so interested in sharing a counter opinion rather than simply taking pot-shots at systemd. pbui followed with an update about [Oragono](https://github.com/oragono/oragono),
which is a lightweight IRC server he has running to host our NDLUG IRC server.
Zephan followed with a quick note about how some software vendors package old QT version with their software and aired some grievances about it.

## Battlestations

We had a number of members send in their setups to be reviewed/roasted/talked about. In the Twitch VOD this begins around minute 55. We had a wide variety of setups - a MacBook docked with an external monitor and a mechanical keyboard, a Nord themed Manjaro desktop, an Arch install with Polybar and i3-gaps (how original), and some Windows users setups in their dorm rooms. It was a lot of fun to see how everyone customizes both their desktop/laptop itself and their peripherals (mouse, keyboard, etc.).
