## Virtual LUG!

While other FOSS institutions may be stuck in their old ways, NDLUG took the many changes we've all been
experiencing over the last few months as an opportunity to embrace virtual events and learning. To do so,
we've started a new initiative - **The NDLUG Podcast**!

## Motivation and Format

Since meetings cannot be held in person, we decided that rather than attempting to move the old meeting
format to an online format, we would adopt a different meeting approach. Our podcast participants engage
in casual ~~shilling~~ conversation streamed live to Twitch, where they can interact with LUG members
through the chat. We have been heavily influenced by podcasts such as [Linux Unplugged](https://linuxunplugged.com/)
and [Destination Linux](https://destinationlinux.org/) - check 'em out if you're interested! Our goal is
to grow our community in an accessible way while still maintaining and sharing the core mission(s) of NDLUG.

## Our First Podcast - FOSS News
With this initial podcast, our hosts introduced the general format to the community. They discussed
various current events in FOSS and did their best to present different opinions and arguments on the
matters. Please check out the recordings below to stay up to date!
