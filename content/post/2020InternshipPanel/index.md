#### Emory

Emory, a Computer Engineering major, worked at the
Notre Dame Center for Civic Innovation. She detailed her experience in more of an Engineering Manager/Consultant
role and discussed her role which, given that she worked closely with a small group, included a lot of interaction directly with her client.

#### Sam
Sam worked for Pure Storage this summer, a Bay Area company that deals in business to business storage
solutions. Sam discussed working for a mid-sized Bay Area tech company, the challenges of remote work, and his project for the summer.

#### Gavin
Gavin worked for Amazon this summer on a team in the Devices, Digital, and Consumer Support organization.
He detailed what it was like to work for Amazon, discussed its culture, and talked about his team and what they do.

## Conclusion

Each internship panelist talked about the application process for their respective roles, the challenges of the
experience, how prepared they felt with a CS/CPEG education from ND, and what classes they felt were most
applicable directly to their jobs. The panel concluded with a piece of advice from each panelist, which mostly
focused on "grinding Leetcode", not getting discouraged by rejection, and practicing whenever possible.
