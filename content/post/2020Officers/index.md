## Special Thanks

I want to send off Noah Yoshida and Logan Yokum for their hard work this past year as Treasurer and President. They really helped build the club into what it is today and make the transition team for the new government much easier. I would also like to thank any other LUG senior who particpated in the club. We thank you for your continued interest in the club.
